  - short: "Code design & organization"
    long: "I was much more careful in the design of the code than I have been in the past. Knowing from the start that this would be a code-heavy project encouraged me to carefully plan out the structure of the codebase. This increased attention to design also led me to make a much more modular, understandable, and easy-to-modify codebase than I might have otherwise made, which are design goals that I will continue to apply to my new projects from now on."
  - short: "Performance optimization"
    long: "To run our simulations of ~ 100 million distillations, we needed to do some very heavy performance optimizations on the code to achieve runtimes of a few hours. The first iterations of the simulation code would have taken days or months to do the same thing. I learned a lot about profiling, parallelization, smart use of memory, batching, and large-scale memoization during this project."
