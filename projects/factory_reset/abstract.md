Magic state distillation is a key component of fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, we find that it is susceptible to variety of physical noise sources, thereby degrading quantum programs. The Verity kernel dynamically estimates T infidelities using already available measurement syndromes from the 15-1 T distillery. These estimates can be used to diagnose faulty devices, triggering dynamic recalibrations as noise events occur, and can also provide accurate estimates of mean fidelity over the entire program duration. Our long-time evaluations show that Verity seamlessly adapts to different noise environments, without requiring device characterization: in stable noise regimes, Verity operates at competitive cost, and in challenging noise regimes, Verity maintains infidelity guarantees where existing baselines degrade or completely fail.
