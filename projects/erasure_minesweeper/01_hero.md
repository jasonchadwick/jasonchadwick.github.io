Figure 1. Viewing a hybrid-erasure architecture as a game of Minesweeper. *Top:* In a standard surface code, we receive syndrome bits (red and blue 1s) indicating that an error string terminates nearby. The decoder must find a valid explanation (red and blue flags) based only on this information. If the decoder guesses wrong, a logical error can occur. *Bottom:* When some data qubits are *erasure qubits*, we gain extra information before decoding (black bombs and green checks on left) that help us decide which error string to predict, avoiding logical errors.
