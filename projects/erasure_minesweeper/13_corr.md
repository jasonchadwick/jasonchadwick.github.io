Figure 13. Effect of spatial placement of erasure qubits in a $$d=7$$ surface code. Color indicates correlation between logical error rate and presence of an erasure qubit at each location in the $$7 \times 7$$ grid of data qubits. Correlations are shown for $$\bar Z$$ (top), $$\bar X$$ (middle) and combined (bottom) error rates. "Checkerboard" patterns are evident in $$\bar Z$$ and $$\bar X$$ data but disappear for combined data.
