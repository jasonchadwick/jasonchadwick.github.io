Figure 7. Logical memory performance of surface code of varying distance and varying fraction of erasure qubits, distributed according to our optimized heuristic. *Top:* For fixed code distance $$d=7$$, increasing the fraction of erasure qubits improves $$d_\text{eff}$$, evidenced by a steeper slope. *Bottom:* Increasing the fraction of erasure qubits also increases $$p_\text{th}$$, the crossing point for different distances.
