Quantum computing is in an era of limited resources. Current hardware lacks high fidelity gates, long coherence times, and the number of computational \replaced{units}{devices} required to perform meaningful computation. Current quantum devices typically use a binary system, where each qubit exists in a superposition of the $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ state\added{s}. However, it is often possible to access the $\ket{2}$ or even $\ket{3}$ states in these same \replaced{physical unit}{device}  \added{by manipulating the system in different ways}. In this work, we consider \added{automatically} encoding two qubits into one four-state qu\emph{quart} \added{via a \emph{compression} scheme}. We use quantum optimal control to design efficient \added{proof-of-concept} gates that fully replicate standard qubit computation on these encoded qubits. We extend qubit compilation schemes to efficiently route qubits on an arbitrary mixed-radix system consisting of both qubits and ququarts, reducing communication and minimizing excess circuit execution time introduced by longer-duration ququart gates. \added{In conjunction with these compilation strategies}, we introduce several methods to find beneficial compressions, reducing circuit error due to computation and communication by up to 50\%.  Together, these methods can increase the computational space available on a limited near-term machine by up to 2x while maintaining circuit fidelity.
