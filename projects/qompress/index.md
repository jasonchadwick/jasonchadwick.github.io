contributions:
  - "Used time-optimal pulse optimization software to generate fast pulses for qubit-qubit, qubit-ququart, and ququart-ququart gates."
  - "Provided feedback and suggestions for compiler design."
thingslearned:
  - short: "Intro to quantum compiler research"
    long: "As my first project fully in the quantum computer systems space, I learned about the state of the art in quantum compiler design, and the considerations that go into creating and benchmarking a novel compiler."
