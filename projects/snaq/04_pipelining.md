Figure 4. Example pipeline schedule showing initialization, data entanglement, and measurement for two successive rounds of ancilla qubits, split into three waves each. The measurement of the first round of ancillae can be done simultaneously with the initialization of the second round. Any blank space in the schedule indicates idling, during which dynamical decoupling techniques could be used to improve coherence.
