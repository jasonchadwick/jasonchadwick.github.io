contributions:
  - "Recognized mismatch of readout components and qubits and developed the SNAQ approach."
  - "Wrote detailed simulation software to accurately model the serialized, pipelined waves of ancilla qubits."
  - "Performed simulations to study SNAQ's sensitivity to key parameters and to explore logical operations."
  - "Wrote manuscript."
