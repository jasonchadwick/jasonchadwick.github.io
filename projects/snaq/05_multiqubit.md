Figure 5. Two possible implementations of multiqubit operations in the SNAQ architecture. (a) Lattice surgery can connect distant logical qubits via a channel of "routing patches" (lighter shaded stabilizers), which requires a wider dot array to support a second column of surface codes. (b) Spin shuttling enables transversal CNOT operations for sufficiently-close tiles. Between stabilizer measurement rounds, physical qubits can shuttle past intermediate tiles to reach the target tile, then perform the transversal operation and shuttle back.
