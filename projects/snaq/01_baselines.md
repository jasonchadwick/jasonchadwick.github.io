Table 1. Comparison to prior fault-tolerant silicon architecture proposals. This summary contrasts the UnitCell and Bilinear baselines with SNAQ, highlighting our proposal's focus on near-term manufacturability, strong low-distance performance, and efficient logical operations. Unlike the baselines, which are limited to lattice surgery (LS), SNAQ's dense design supports fast transversal CNOTs (tCNOTs), enabling a more flexible, high-parallelism logical layout. The "1D++" logical connectivity of SNAQ refers to the potential parallelism of transversal operations compared to lattice surgery.
