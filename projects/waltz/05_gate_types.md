Figure 5. Examples of mixed-radix two-control and two-target gates. a) A configuration where both controls are encoded in the ququart and the target is mapped to a qubit. b) A configuration where the controls are split across the qubit and the ququart and the target is encoded in the ququart. c) A configuration where both targets are encoded in the ququart and the control is mapped to the qubit. d) A configuration where the targets are split across the qubit and the ququart and the control is encoded in the ququart.
