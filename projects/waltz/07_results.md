Figure 7. Simulated results for QRAM, Generalized Toffoli, Cuccaro Adder and Select Circuit from 5 to 21 qubits with different mixed-radix and full-ququart compilation strategies. The mixed-radix strategies do not have complete error bars due to the requirement to simulate a four-level system for every qubit which would require more than 86 GB of memory per circuit in our simulation framework. The final graph is the average fidelity improvement for each compilation method over the qubit-only compilation method as the size of the circuit increases.
