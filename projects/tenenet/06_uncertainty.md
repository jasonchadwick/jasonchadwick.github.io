Figure 6. Probability density of prediction errors (normalized by uncertainty estimate) for ne (top) and ne T e (bottom) profile shapes. The
left column shows results calculated on the validation dataset with the standard deviation of the ensemble of trained model predictions as the
uncertainty estimate. The middle column shows results calculated on the validation dataset with the standard deviation of the Monte Carlo
dropout ensemble predictions as the uncertainty estimate. The right column shows the results for the Monte Carlo case evaluated on the test
dataset. A reference normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) is shown as a black dashed line.
