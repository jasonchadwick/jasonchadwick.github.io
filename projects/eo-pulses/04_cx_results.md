Figure 4. Optimized CX sequence lengths, grouped by permutation equivalence class. Within each class, blue line spreads from minimum to maximum sequence length and black x denotes mean. For rectangular-grid topologies, dark blue represents the "control" qubit of the CX and light purple the "target". For non-rectangular-grid topologies, dark green represents the "control" and gold the "target".
