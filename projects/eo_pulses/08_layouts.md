Figure 8. *Top:* The four dot layouts considered in this study. Names denote the qubit-level connectivity (Grid or Hex) and the dot-level connectivity (Linear, L, Tri). Thick dark blue lines indicate intra-qubit connections and thin gray lines indicate inter-qubit connections. *Bottom:* Example CX pulse sequences for three different two-EO-qubit connectivities. More densely-connected qubits yield shorter pulse counts (23 for Linear vs. 18 for DenseTri); however, note that the number of fully-parallel layers (14-15) remains similar.
