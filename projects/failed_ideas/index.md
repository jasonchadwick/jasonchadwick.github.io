# Failed Research Ideas

Coming soon!

This page contains summaries of projects that I initially thought were promising and put some fair effort into, but didn't end up working out as I had hoped. In the spirit of encouraging a more open scientific community regarding negative results, and with the hopes of maybe sparking a cool research project for someone else reading this, I am collecting some of my more interesting failed projects here. (It's also a nice way to practice scientific writing and explaining).

If something on this page leads you to a *successful* project, I would greatly appreciate it if you [cite/acknowledge this page](#citing-this-page)! In return, I will do my best to keep the page updated with any newly-published results that solve these problems.

## Multiqubit gate decompositions for neutral atom computers (summer 2022)
[github](https://github.com/jasonchadwick/decomp)

TODO

## Volume-robust two-qubit basis gates (spring 2023)

TODO

## Improved *in situ* recalibration of surface code qubits (summer 2023)

This project was inspired by ["Scalable *in situ* qubit calibration during repetitive error detection"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.032321) by Kelly et al. at Google.

TODO

## Recalibrating magic state factories (fall 2023)

We ended up figuring out how to get this to work (resulting in two papers, Verity and Factory Reset). However, there were many (MANY) things we tried during the course of this project and found to not work very well.

TODO

<!-- ### Changing injection corner to avoid TLSs

TODO

### Estimating output error rate from stabilizer syndrome rate
