## I. Multiqubit gate decompositions for neutral atom computers (summer 2022)

## II. Volume-robust two-qubit basis gates (spring 2023)

TODO

## III. Improved *in situ* recalibration of surface code qubits (summer 2023)

This project was inspired by ["Scalable *in situ* qubit calibration during repetitive error detection"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.032321) by Kelly et al. at Google.

TODO

## IV. Recalibrating magic state factories (fall 2023)

We ended up figuring out how to get this to work (resulting in two papers, Verity and Factory Reset). However, there were many (MANY) things we tried during the course of this project and found to not work very well.
