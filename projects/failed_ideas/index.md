# Failed Research Ideas

Coming soon!

<!-- ## Trapped Ion Optimal Control (spring 2023) -->

<!-- ## Improved in-situ surface code recalibration (summer 2023) -->

## Multiqubit gate decompositions for neutral atom computers (summer 2022)

## Recalibrating magic state factories (fall 2023)

### Changing injection corner to avoid TLSs

TODO

### Estimating output error rate from stabilizer syndrome rate
