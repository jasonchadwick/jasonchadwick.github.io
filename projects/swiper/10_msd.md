Figure 10. SWIPER-SIM program traces for a 15-to-1 magic
state distillation in a distance-7 code using the construction
from [24] (Fig. 17). Time advances vertically, and each horizontal slice represents a batch of syndrome data (colored by
instruction type). Decoding time is fixed to be the same as
the time to generate 2d rounds, about twice the window generation rate. Device traces are shown for (a) baseline parallel
window method (15.1d QEC rounds) and (b) SWIPER aligned
window (11.3d QEC rounds, a 25% improvement).
