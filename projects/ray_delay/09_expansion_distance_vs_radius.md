Figure 9. Extra code distance needed to tolerate **Direct** events of varying radius (assuming perfect decoder knowledge). Three plots show logical error rate as a function of ray radius, showing that larger rays degrade code distance more. Blue dashed line indicates $d=7$ error rate in the no-ray case. Each error rate plot shows the larger of either logical idle error rate (selected for $f_{T_1}=0.1$) or T rotation lattice surgery error rate (selected for $f_{T_1}=0.01$ and $0.001$), both obtained via Stim simulation. *Bottom right:* We can extract the required additional code distance for a given ray radius and strength. This determines the overhead of the *Code expansion* baseline.
