contributions:
  - "Conceived of the idea of quickly detecting cosmic rays in a magic state factory and selectively turning off parts of the factory in response."
  - "Designed realistic noise models for cosmic ray impacts and TLS scrambling."
  - "Wrote open-source evaluation code."
  - "Designed figures and prepared manuscript."
thingslearned:
  - short: "Rare event sampling"
    long: "As a computer systems researcher, my first instinct to calculate the time overhead of this approach was to directly run Monte Carlo simulations of cosmic ray events during the operation of the factory. ...TODO"
