contributions:
  - "Conceived of the idea of quickly detecting cosmic rays in a magic state factory and selectively turning off parts of the factory in response."
  - "Designed realistic noise models for cosmic ray impacts and TLS scrambling."
  - "Wrote open-source evaluation code."
  - "Designed figures and prepared manuscript."
