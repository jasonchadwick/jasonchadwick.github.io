Figure 12. *Top:* Distillation overhead of re-mapping method under varying detection latency for **Direct** model. Detection latencies are obtained from Figure 5. Ray rate value $\Gamma \times T_{\text{offline}}$ is fixed at $10^{-5}$. *Bottom:* Distillation overhead of re-mapping method under varying detection latency for **Scrambling** model. Detection latencies are obtained from Figure 6.
