Figure 3. The two cosmic ray noise models studied in this work. From left to right, we show the effect of a representative ray on the physical qubit $T_1$ times, the decoherence error rate over $3\mu$s (the time period used in [23]), and the chance that each surface code stabilizer measurement will detect an error. *Top:* The **Direct** model is based on [23]. A ray impact directly affects the $T_1$ times of qubits within some radius, becoming less severe with distance. *Bottom:* The **Direct** model is based on [22], [44]. A ray impact scrambles TLS defects in some area, leading to unpredictable and long-lasting effects on qubit coherence.
