Figure 5. Different reference point granularities translate to varying amounts of classical computation time needed to optimize all reference pulses. Consecutive points with the same granularity $g$ correspond to subsequent re-optimization rounds, which can further improve average (and maximum) infidelity at the cost of more optimizer iterations. Each optimization iteration corresponds to one system evolution. The points indicated by the plus sign indicate the worst infidelity of any test point.
