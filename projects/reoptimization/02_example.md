Figure 2. Overview of the example of our method provided in this work. More details on this specific example are provided in Section V. a) We use the Cartan decomposition (6) to define a three-dimensional space that contains all two-qubit operations. Our goal is to efficiently generate pulses for any arbitrary point within this continuous space. b) We choose several *reference operations* within the space and generate control pulses that implement these operations via optimal control software. Interpolating between these reference pulses does not necessarily provide a high-quality pulse immediately. c) To solve this problem, we iteratively re-optimize each reference pulse to be more similar to the average of nearby reference pulses, a process we call *neighbor-average re-optimization*. This process is described in Section II. d) Once these reference pulses have been fully calibrated, we can instantly obtain control pulses for any operation in the continuous family by performing linear interpolation between the nearest reference pulses. This process is described in more detail in Section III.
