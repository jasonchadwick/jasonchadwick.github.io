Figure 2. Comparison of pulse shapes for two adjacent reference points before and after several rounds of re-optimization. Point A corresponds to Cartan coordinates $(\frac 1 4, 0, 0)$ and point B corresponds to coordinates $(\frac 1 4, \frac 1 4, \frac 1 4)$ in the same results as displayed in Figure 1. Controls from the two points are shown for the $\sigma_x \sigma_x$ control (top) and $\sigma_z^{(1)}$ control (bottom) of the Hamiltonian (Equation (8)). *Inset*: locations of points A and B in the Weyl chamber. *Left*: the pulse shapes are initially significantly different between points A and B. *Right*: the pulses become far more similar after re-optimization, making interpolation easier, but still retain certain differences in their shapes that account for the differences in the resulting operations.
