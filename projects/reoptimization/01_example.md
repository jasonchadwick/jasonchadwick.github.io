Figure 1. Example of the re-optimization scheme. Axes on the
top plots correspond to the three Cartan coordinates of two-
qubit gates. Reference pulses are generated by optimal control
software for 14 reference points in parameter space. Pulses for
any point in the chamber can be obtained by linear interpolation between reference pulses. Left: interpolated pulse infi-
delities at 285 test points after initial optimization of reference
points. Black lines connect reference points and each colored
point represents an interpolated pulse. The yellow-colored region indicates poor interpolation quality. Mean infidelity is
$5.1 \pm 15 \times 10^{−2}$ . Right: results after repeatedly re-optimizing
each reference point to be near the average of its neighbors.
Mean infidelity is improved to $5.5 \pm 5.7 \times 10^{−4}$ .
