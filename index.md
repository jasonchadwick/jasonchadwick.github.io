I am a second-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

<!-- The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computers is that, given large enough quantum computers, error rates can be exponentially suppressed to enable highly-accurate computations. However, quantum error correction relies on models that make stringent assumptions about many aspects of devices, such as the structure and magnitude of physical gate errors, the capabilities of control software, and resilience to disruptive events such as cosmic rays.  -->

My research interests focus on the application of computational methods to improve quantum hardware performance. This includes work such as optimizing the performance of individual quantum logic gates, designing scalable and efficient device calibration routines, and dynamically modifying error correction circuits to account for the imperfections of real devices. Hardware-software co-design is essential in quantum computing, both to get the best performance out of a given quantum device and to effectively guide the next generation of hardware. I am familiar with key challenges in the control of large-scale quantum hardware through my research on quantum control and my discussions with experimentalists, while I also understand the design requirements of fault tolerant devices via my quantum error correction research. I enjoy working across this large abstraction gap to co-design error correction routines and hardware control to work together.

So far, I have published in the areas of *control pulse engineering*, *device calibration*, *circuit compilation*, and *high-radix computation*, and am currently working on projects in *quantum error correction*. I have mostly focused on superconducting quantum hardware, but I am familiar with neutral atom and trapped ion architectures as well.
