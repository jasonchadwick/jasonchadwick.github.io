I am a final-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022 with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

I'm interested in computer systems/architecture research for quantum computing. I believe that co-designing quantum hardware and software is essential to make scalable quantum computing a reality. I am currently working on [tailoring](#Serialized Syndrome Extraction for Surface Codes in Readout-Constrained Spin Qubit Arrays) QEC to [hardware](#Erasure Minesweeper: exploring hybrid-erasure surface code architectures for efficient quantum error correction) and improving [real-time decoding](#SWIPER: Minimizing Fault-Tolerant Quantum Program Latency via Speculative Window Decoding). Previously, I have published work on [software mitigation](#Averting multi-qubit burst errors in surface code magic state factories) of [time-varying noise](#Dynamic mitigation of time-varying noise in surface code magic state factories) (such as cosmic ray impacts and shifting two-level system defects) in the surface code, quantum [control pulse](#Efficient control pulses for continuous quantum gate families through coordinated re-optimization) [optimization](#Time-Efficient Qudit Gates through Incremental Pulse Re-seeding), and a pair of papers on [compiling](#Dancing the Quantum Waltz: Compiling Three-Qubit Gates on Four Level Architectures) with [ququarts](#Qompress: Efficient Compilation for Ququarts Exploiting Partial and Mixed Radix Operations for Communication Reduction).

In the summer of 2024, I interned with the quantum computing team at Intel, where I explored the relationship between qubit configuration and two-qubit gate schedules, providing guidance for Intel’s quantum roadmap. Check out the [publication](#Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in two-dimensional layouts)!

In the summer of 2025, I once again interned at Intel, where I studied experimental crosstalk data and developed internal simulation tools in Python and C++ to model the impact of capacitive crosstalk in realistic QEC schedules.
