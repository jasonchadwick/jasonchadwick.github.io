I am a second-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

<!-- The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computers is that, given large enough quantum computers, error rates can be exponentially suppressed to enable highly-accurate computations. However, quantum error correction relies on models that make stringent assumptions about many aspects of devices, such as the structure and magnitude of physical gate errors, the capabilities of control software, and resilience to disruptive events such as cosmic rays.  -->

Hardware-software co-design is essential in quantum computing, both to get the best performance out of a given quantum device and to effectively guide the next generation of hardware. My research currently focuses on methods to improve the performance of quantum error correction on real quantum devices. I have most recently been working on [software mitigation](/projects/factory_reset/) of [time-varying noise](#Dynamic mitigation of time-varying noise in surface code magic state factories) (such as cosmic ray impacts and shifting two-level system defects) in the surface code. Previously, I have also published work in quantum control [pulse](#Efficient control pulses for continuous quantum gate families through coordinated re-optimization) [optimization](#Time-Efficient Qudit Gates through Incremental Pulse Re-seeding) and a pair of papers on [compiling](#Dancing the Quantum Waltz: Compiling Three-Qubit Gates on Four Level Architectures) with [ququarts](#Qompress: Efficient Compilation for Ququarts Exploiting Partial and Mixed Radix Operations for Communication Reduction). My work so far has mostly had superconducting hardware in mind, but I have also worked with trapped ion and neutral atom architectures. I am currently working on moving more into the quantum error correction space, focusing on topics such as biased-noise QEC and decoding.
