I am a second-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computers is that, given large enough quantum computers, error rates can be exponentially suppressed to enable highly-accurate computations. However, quantum error correction relies on models that make stringent assumptions about many aspects of devices, such as the structure and magnitude of physical gate errors, the capabilities of control software, and resilience to disruptive events such as cosmic rays. 

My research interests can be described as low-level software optimizations that narrow the gap between existing far-from-ideal hardware and the future goal of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. This includes work such as optimizing the performance of individual quantum logic gates, designing scalable and efficient device calibration routines, and modifying error correction circuits to account for typically-ignored imperfections of real devices. So far, I have worked on research in the areas of <span style="color:var(--text); font-weight: bold">control pulse engineering</span>, <span style="color:var(--text); font-weight: bold">device calibration</span>, and <span style="color:var(--text); font-weight: bold">high-radix computation</span>. I have mostly focused on superconducting quantum hardware, but I am familiar with neutral atom and trapped ion architectures as well. My work is part of <a href="https://www.epiqc.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPiQC</a>, an NSF Expedition in Computing.
