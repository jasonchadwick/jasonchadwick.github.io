I am a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

My research focuses on low-level software optimizations that narrow the gap between existing error-prone hardware and the future goal of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation, improving the efficiency and reliability of current and near-term quantum machines. My work is part of <a href="https://www.epiqc.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EPiQC</a>, an NSF Expedition in Computing.
