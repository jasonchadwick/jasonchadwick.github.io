I am a third-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago studying quantum computer systems with <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Chong</a>. In the summer of 2024, I interned with the quantum computing team at Intel. Previously, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2022 with a B.S. in physics and a minor in computer science. 

Hardware-software co-design is essential in quantum computing, both to get the best performance out of a given quantum device and to effectively guide the next generation of hardware. My research currently focuses on methods to improve the performance of quantum error correction on real quantum devices. I have most recently been working on [software mitigation](#Averting multi-qubit burst errors in surface code magic state factories) of [time-varying noise](#Dynamic mitigation of time-varying noise in surface code magic state factories) (such as cosmic ray impacts and shifting two-level system defects) in the surface code. Previously, I have also published work in [quantum control](#Efficient control pulses for continuous quantum gate families through coordinated re-optimization) pulse [optimization](#Time-Efficient Qudit Gates through Incremental Pulse Re-seeding) and a pair of papers on [compiling](#Dancing the Quantum Waltz: Compiling Three-Qubit Gates on Four Level Architectures) with [ququarts](#Qompress: Efficient Compilation for Ququarts Exploiting Partial and Mixed Radix Operations for Communication Reduction). My work so far has mostly had superconducting hardware in mind, but I have also worked with trapped ion and neutral atom architectures. I am currently working on moving more into the quantum error correction space, focusing on topics such as biased-noise QEC and decoding.
