        short: A board game consisting of hexagonal tiles, with each tile corresponding to a qubit. Players take turns applying quantum operations to the board to try to steer the collective board state to their target state. Graphical edition coming soon!

        short: "In the summer of 2019, I worked with Ken Olum at the Tufts Institute of Cosmology to study the properties of smooth cosmic string loops. I began the summer running computational simulations of cosmic strings and later transitioned to working on a mathematical proof that smooth cosmic string loops will always decay."

  #     #   short: A collection of research ideas I have tried and have not had success with - because science should encourage dissemination of negative results more!

  #       short: In my junior year of undergrad, some friends and I created a makeshift band to fill an open spot in CMU's annual Spring Carnival. Because we formed the band two weeks before the show date, we chose the fitting name "Last Minute". I'm all the way on stage left playing rhythm guitar! Check out 42:20 for some improvised solos at the end.
