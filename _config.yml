      - title: "Qompress: Efficient Compilation for Ququarts Exploiting Partial and Mixed Radix Operations for Communication Reduction"
        file: /projects/qompress/index.md
        short: We consider selectively compressing pairs of qubits into single four-state ququarts. We generate control pulses that operate on this mixed-radix space and develop a compiler to transform any quantum circuit into this framework.

      - title: "Time-Efficient Qudit Gates through Incremental Pulse Re-seeding"
        file: /projects/ipr/index.md
        short: "We present a method to iteratively obtain short-duration quantum control pulses when it is not possible to directly modify the objective function. We use this to find gate durations for high-radix logic gates that scale better than expected."

      - title: Prediction of electron density and pressure profile shapes on NSTX-U using neural networks
        file: /projects/tenenet/index.md
        short: We develop a neural network to accurately predict cross-sectional shapes of plasma density and pressure on the NSTX-U fusion reactor. The network runs orders of magnitude faster than existing physics-based code.

        file: /projects/chronodrifter/index.md
        short: A 2D platformer game where the player can slow and reverse the flow of time to solve increasingly complex puzzles. Inspired by the game Portal and the movie Tenet. A live web version is hosted on this site. Made with Unity and C#.

        short: A board game consisting of hexagonal tiles, with each tile corresponding to a qubit. Players take turns applying quantum operations to the board to try to steer the collective board state to their target state. Graphical edition coming soon!

        img: /assets/img/projects/strings.png
        short: "In the summer of 2019, I worked with Ken Olum at the Tufts Institute of Cosmology to study the properties of smooth cosmic string loops. I began the summer running computational simulations of cosmic strings and later transitioned to working on a mathematical proof that smooth cosmic string loops will always decay."

        short: In my junior year of undergrad, some friends and I created a makeshift band to fill an open spot in CMU's annual Spring Carnival. Because we formed the band two weeks before the show date, we chose the fitting name "Last Minute". I'm all the way on stage left playing rhythm guitar!
