        short: We consider selectively compressing pairs of qubits into single four-state ququarts. We generate efficient "partial" operations between ququarts and qubits, which motivates a compiler that can transform any quantum circuit into this framework.

  #       short: In my junior year of undergrad, some friends and I created a makeshift band to fill an open spot in CMU's annual Spring Carnival. Because we formed the band two weeks before the show date, we chose the fitting name "Last Minute". I'm all the way on stage left playing rhythm guitar! Check out 42:20 for some improvised solos at the end.
